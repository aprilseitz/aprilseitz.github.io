                <p>&emsp;The first asian restaurant in America was opened in San Francisco california. It was named canton restaurant. It was the first of many waves of chinese and asian restaurants that would come to america and share cultural foods with the rest of the states. Restaurants were a good path for immigrants who werenâ€™t well versed in English. This was how they could connect across culture in a very tangible way. IN fact, asian restaurants owe a larger part of their success to how early restauranteers changed their menus and ingredients to fit the american palate.     </p>
