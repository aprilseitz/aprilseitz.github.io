                <p>&emsp;This law, also known as the hart-celler act, lightened the quotas on non-european immigration. While this only applied to skilled workers, this opened the door for thousands of immigrants to take a swing at the American dream. It lowered the disparity of race-based quotas and would lead to the melting pot of a nation that we have today. </p>
