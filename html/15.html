                <p>&emsp;To this day, asian americans continue to bring their culture to America and create art that wouldn’t have existed otherwise. Food continues to be a common method of sharing cultures. Now that the immigration laws aren’t as strict, more communities and restaurants can appear from different countries. Also, asian american music and film have started gaining popularity. Bollywood films are no longer ridiculed, and the average american is enjoying them. Fusion styles of music like japanese style jazz have become part of mainstream culture. This happens especially due to the internet. People in general have learned the art of tolerance, paving the way for meaningful connections between communities that might never have come together in the first place. </p>
