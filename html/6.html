                <p>&emsp;In 1882 the Chinese exclusion act was signed into law. It was a complete ban on Chinese laborer immigrants for 10 years. (students and merchants were allowed) It also excluded those already in the US from citizenship rights. With the law, racist attacks also increast since their sentiments were echoed in legislation. Some of these include the rock springs and hellâ€™s canyon massacres. After the law expired, the Geary act was passed to extend the ban for 10 more years. There were also added restrictions on residence, requiring all Chinese to have certificates of residence under the threat of deportation. The law was replaced with quotas for all immigrant groups in 1943 when China became an ally of the US. </p>
