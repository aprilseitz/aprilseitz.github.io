                <p>&emsp;The korean war was the manifestation of years of the cold war’s tension. The US government felt a responsibility to stop the spread of communism, while the soviet union wanted to expand the influence of communism. THis finally became an armed conflict between north and south korea. Obviously, there were war crimes, but also, at home people felt the effects too. The red scare was not only limited to russians or people who didn’t politically fit into the american ideal. Koreans and other immigrants faced suspicion and alienation since, by their racial appearance, were associated with the korean venture into communism. </p>
