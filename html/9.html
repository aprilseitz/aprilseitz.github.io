                <p>&emsp;The creation of this battalion was another step towards letting people of other races into the “american dream”. The first legal racial integration of the army happened during the civil war, where black soldiers were allowed to fight against the confederacy. Their legacy is continued during world war 2, when japanese-american soldiers were allowed to enlist for their country, rather than their racial background.  </p>
