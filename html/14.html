                <p>&emsp;These were organized by the Agricultural Workers Organization Committee. While you might imagine mexican and south american farmers, but many filipino workers were also involved. In fact, one of the leaders, larry itilong, was filipino. The strikes resulted in a raise for the farm workers. Even though improvement was still necessary, (the wages were below minimum wage) the workers still received raises and improved conditions. A lot of the strikeâ€™s success is owed to the consumer boycotts that resulted from public support of the workers. The strike would inspire more agricultural strikes leading to unions and solidarity between different groups of workers.     </p>
