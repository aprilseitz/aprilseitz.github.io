                <p>&emsp;This website was created in response to the diminished coverage of Asian American history in the American Studies course. While of course there has been progress, there can always be improvement. My hopes for this website are that it will educate those now and in the future as a resource on the BC LibGuide. It should also encourage those who feel the curriculum does not represent them to point out the ways we can learn even more and gain an even more nuanced view of what it means to be American. Along with our BC American Studies course, we can  also consider what the education is like for students in other schools that might not have the same freedom to ask for change in their class content. From there the question is if the curriculum can change on an even higher level.</p>
