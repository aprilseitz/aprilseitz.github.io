                <p>&emsp;this massacre resulted from conflict between white and chinese miners in wyoming. Anti asian sentiment was running high at the time due to the earlier exclusions acts and general racism/xenophobia of the time. White miners thought that the Chinese were taking the jobs unfairly, along with how some CHinese laborers unwittingly broke a white minersâ€™ strike by replacing he white workers. This resulted in at least 28 casualties and arson.  </p>
