                <p>&emsp; During the second world war, the us and japan were on opposite sides. After the attack on pearl harbor, the us public was highly suspicious of japanese citizens, regardless of any criminal activity or association with japan. The government was influenced by these opinions, so they constructed “camps” to keep japanese people during the war. They resulted in mass disruption of the japanese’s livelihoods and communities.  </p>
