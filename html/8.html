                <p>&emsp;In 1887, a group called the “Bayonet Consitution” coerced hawa’i’s king, King kalakaua into passing laws that prioritized white settlers in terms of political power. Against the US president Grover cleveland ’s condemnations, other white settlers overthrew the last monarch of hawai’i in 1893. The coup resulted in the establishment of the republic of hawai’i. Soon, the government was interested in the annexation of hawai’i by the US. Some agreed, thinking that hawai’i would be a way into pacific trade and economic deals, while others thought it was too much effort or that it would give citizenship to native people “not deserving” of those rights.     </p>
