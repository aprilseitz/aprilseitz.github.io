                <p>&emsp;  People v.s. Hall was written in response to a Chinese person testifying against a white man accused of murder. The court decided that the Chinese person’s testimony was invalid because of qualities thought to be inherent to the Chinese “race”. Law had already categorized Black, mixed, and Indian as races that were “marked as inferior” and thus were not capable of “swearing away the life of a citizen”. With the addition of People v.s. Hall, Chinese people were added to the existing list. Because of this, Chinese people were denied the right to legal defense against any crime, or to even serve as a witness for an unrelated case in which they weren’t directly involved. This is historically significant because the law categorized Chinese people, along with other races, as non-citizens. Categorizations such as these set precedents that these races were not all valued as Americans.
